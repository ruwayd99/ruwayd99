## Personal Projects

### [RISC Machine](https://github.com/ruwayd99/Reduced-Instruction-Set-Computer)
- **Languages and tools:** Verilog, SystemVerilog, ModelSim, Quartus, FPGA, DE1-SoC Board
- Implemented a Turing Complete 16-bit RISC machine using System Verilog on an FPGA board
- Subdivided machine into smaller modules such as ALU, controller, datapath, RAM to debug easily
- Verified component and integration through RTL and gate level simulation using ModelSim and Quartus

### [Formal verification for 4-bit counter with overflow](https://github.com/ruwayd99/FormalVerification_for_Counter)
- **Languages and tools:** Verilog, SystemVerilog, Yosys
- Independently studied formal verification techniques, implementing assertions and defining a constraint environment for testing a 4-bit counter with overflow
- Utilized the RTL synthesis tool Yosys to execute the testbench

### [Web Scraping Python Script](https://github.com/ruwayd99/WebScraping_PythonScript)
- **Languages and tools:** Python, Beautifulsoup, SQLite, Matplotlib, csv
- Extracted product title and prices from Amazon using Beautifulsoup, fetching links from a CSV
- Efficiently managed data by leveraging a relational database in SQLite and plotted price history using Matplotlib

### Multi-client Server (Code access is available upon request)
- **Languages, tools, and concepts:** Java, Multi-threading, Sockets, IntelliJ
- Built a server for concurrent client interactions capable of fetching sensor data and sending actuator commands
- Implemented thread-safe data types, synchronized methods, and leveraged Java sockets to handle clients

### [File Sharing Website](https://github.com/ruwayd99/TutoringWebsite_Frontend)
- **Languages and tools:** React.js, Flask, MongoDB, GridFS, HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, Figma
- Developed a full-stack React web application to facilitate streamlined document sharing between users
- Constructed a Flask back-end API for efficient handling of file uploads and deletions in MongoDB using GridFS

### [Simon Says](https://github.com/ruwayd99/SimonSays-Game-TinkerCAD)
- **Languages and tools:** C, TinkerCad, Arduino
- Developed an interactive Simon Says game in C using TinkerCad, implementing LED patterns that users replicate by pressing corresponding buttons
- Utilized Arduino functionalities to control LEDs, detect button presses, and manage game logic, creating an engaging and challenging user experience
